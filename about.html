<p class="post-paragraph">
	In 2006, my mom started a blog she called Cottage Bethy. Being four years old at the time, I was quite unfamiliar with this blog, and the following she had created. 
	<br>
	The first memory I have of this blog is one day while in lower school, I went with my mom to pick up my sister from a friend's house. As usual, I was standing next to my mom while she talked to my sister's friend's mom. My mom commented on the decor in the house and how much she loved it. The friend's mom then explained how after just moving from across the country that year, she was inspired by one of her favorite blogs on her new house's style. My mom asked who this blogger was, to find out it was herself! It's a small world after all.
	<br>
	Now, 18 years after its creation, I found myself looking up her blog this year to find it in absolute shambles. The modern internet was no friend to upkeeping this old blog, as seen in the image below. I found this assignment as a perfect opportunity to update her blog to modern web standards. While I have not copied over even most of her old posts, I may plan on completing this mission in the future.
