	i can't do it.  i can't decide how to proceed with this blog, but the private thing just isn't going to happen.   i know some of you were thinking i didn't "invite" you.  nope, i didn't invite anyone!  i never got around to that...too much work!  i need an easier solution.  so until i can figure that out, i thought i would let you know our household has grown!  we have a new little handful.  his name is harrison.  kennedy is a big dog brother!  and elisabeth loves to train him.  we are all back to school here and my full time teaching job is going well.  i have always said i feel alive when i teach.  i'm alive!  yipppeee!  and by the looks of the picture above, i think teaching is in the genes, right, mom?
