<h1 class="post-paragraph-title">wall paper on the ceiling?</h1>
<br>
<p class="post-paragraph">
	a loyal reader (now friend) asked me if i had ever seen wallpaper on the ceiling.  interesting, your timing, my dear!  yes - and i love it!  one of the most beautifully decorated places i have EVER seen is bedford springs resort.  it re-opened last year after being lovingly restored.  the details are to die for!  i took so many pictures, my husband had to stop me.  i was driving him crazy!

here are a few for you...
