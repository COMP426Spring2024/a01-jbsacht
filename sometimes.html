	i have two passions. i love to decorate and i love to teach. decorating is a lot easier. i wonder if i will ever get back in the classroom. i think i would rather open a little shop. lately, i have been playing with the idea of combining the two. i mean, i think about it until my eyes cross...seriously...that is an awful lot of thinking.

	have you ever read miss rumphius? best children's book EVER. go read it, especially if you are a teacher.
