<p class="post-paragraph">
	i was informed that from now on the acquired trailer would be referred to as "the guest house" and it will have a "camp" motif. so now I can’t get the disney movie “the parent trap” out of my head. i am going to watch it for decorating ideas and i may even hang this picture in one of the bedrooms. my mother and i love this movie, so it just seems like the perfect design inspiration. i have to go to home depot to pick out flooring and to restoration hardware to choose the paint. i think i will create a design board just like on the hgtv shows. i saw an old pine oar at lucketts that would look great on the wall. i just want one or two great outdoor items to set the theme, the rest will be clean and simple. any ideas?
